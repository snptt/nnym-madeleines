  abstract = {Xenotransplantation of porcine organs has made remarkable progress towards clinical application. A key factor has been the generation of genetically multi-modified source pigs for xenotransplants, protected against immune rejection and coagulation dysregulation. While efficient gene editing tools and multi-cistronic expression cassettes facilitate sophisticated and complex genetic modifications with multiple gene knockouts and protective transgenes, an increasing number of independently segregating genetic units complicates the breeding of the source pigs. Therefore, an optimal combination of essential genetic modifications may be preferable to extensive editing of the source pigs. Here, we discuss the prioritization of genetic modifications to achieve long-term survival and function of xenotransplants and summarise the genotypes that have been most successful for xenogeneic heart, kidney, and islet transplantation. Specific emphasis is given to the choice of the breed/genetic background of the source pigs. Moreover, multimodal deep phenotyping of porcine organs after xenotransplantation into human decedents will be discussed as a strategy for selecting essential genetic modifications of the source pigs. In addition to germ-line gene editing, some of these modifications may also be induced during organ preservation/perfusion, as demonstrated recently by the successful knockdown of swine leukocyte antigens in porcine lungs during ex vivo perfusion.},

  abstract = {End-stage organ failure can result from various preexisting conditions and occurs in patients of all ages, and organ transplantation remains its only treatment. In recent years, extensive research has been done to explore the possibility of transplanting animal organs into humans, a process referred to as xenotransplantation. Due to their matching organ sizes and other anatomical and physiological similarities with humans, pigs are the preferred organ donor species. Organ rejection due to host immune response and possible interspecies infectious pathogen transmission have been the biggest hurdles to xenotransplantation\&apos;s success. Use of genetically engineered pigs as tissue and organ donors for xenotransplantation has helped to address these hurdles. Although several preclinical trials have been conducted in nonhuman primates, some barriers still exist and demand further efforts.

These studies informed the design of Revivicor’s (Revivicor Inc, Blacksburg, VA) genetically engineered pigs with 10 genetic modifications (10 GE) (including the inactivation of 4 endogenous porcine genes and insertion of 6 human transgenes), whose hearts and kidneys have now been studied in preclinical human xenotransplantation models with brain-dead recipients. Additionally, the first two clinical cases of pig-to-human heart xenotransplantation were recently performed with hearts from this 10 GE pig at the University of Maryland.

  abstract = {The activation of host’s innate and adaptive immune systems can lead to acute and chronic graft rejection, which seriously impacts graft survival. Thus, it is particularly significant to clarify the immune signals, which are critical to the initiation and maintenance of rejection generated after transplantation. The initiation of response to graft is dependent on sensing of danger and stranger molecules. The ischemia and reperfusion of grafts lead to cell stress or death, followed by releasing a variety of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of host immune cells to activate intracellular immune signals and induce sterile inflammation. In addition to DAMPs, the graft exposed to ‘non-self’ antigens (stranger molecules) are recognized by the host immune system, stimulating a more intense immune response and further aggravating the graft damage. The polymorphism of MHC genes between different individuals is the key for host or donor immune cells to identify heterologous ‘non-self’ components in allogeneic and xenogeneic organ transplantation. The recognition of ‘non-self’ antigen by immune cells mediates the activation of immune signals between donor and host, resulting in adaptive memory immunity and innate trained immunity to the graft, which poses a challenge to the long-term survival of the graft. This review focuses on innate and adaptive immune cells receptor recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns, alloantigens and xenoantigens, which is described as danger model and stranger model. In this review, we also discuss the innate trained immunity in organ transplantation.},

  abstract = {Xenotransplantation holds promise to eliminate the shortage of organs intended for humans in need. Pigs constitute the most suitable organ xenograft donor due to the fact that their organ anatomy physiological metabolism and immune system resemble those of humans. However, swine organs rapidly cause hyperacute rejection (HAR) and acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR) after transplantation. HAR and AHXR are caused by the presence of xenoreactive natural immunoglobulins directed toward a galactose alpha1-3-galactose (alpha-Gal) epitope on porcine vascular endothelium. In order to suppress both types of rejection, pigs with alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GT-KO) and other genetic modifications (like simultaneous expression of the human complementary regulatory proteins) are intensively investigated. This review highlights the usefulness of GT-KO pig – derived organs such as kidney, heart, corneal, and lung in xenotransplantation. To obtain transgenic pigs researchers can use several techniques based on pronuclear and cytoplasmic microinjection, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), viral transduction of DNA and DNA transposable element -based technology, site specific nucleases and modifications of the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system. Some additional strategies like targeted immunosuppression or tolerance induction of B and T cells will be essential for sustained survival of xenografts. Although xenotransplantation with the use of pigs is a very rapidly evolving field, more research is needed to create perfectly compatible with the human immune system organs.},

  abstract = {The shortage of organs for transplantation emphasizes the urgent need for alternative solutions. Xenotransplantation has emerged as a promising option due to the greater availability of donor organs. However, significant hurdles such as hyperacute rejection and organ ischemia–reperfusion injury pose major challenges, largely orchestrated by the complement system, and activated immune responses. The complement system, a pivotal component of innate immunity, acts as a natural barrier for xenotransplantation. To address the challenges of immune rejection, gene-edited pigs have become a focal point, aiming to shield donor organs from human immune responses and enhance the overall success of xenotransplantation. This comprehensive review aims to illuminate strategies for regulating complement networks to optimize the efficacy of gene-edited pig xenotransplantation. We begin by exploring the impact of the complement system on the effectiveness of xenotransplantation. Subsequently, we delve into the evaluation of key complement regulators specific to gene-edited pigs. To further understand the status of xenotransplantation, we discuss preclinical studies that utilize gene-edited pigs as a viable source of organs. These investigations provide valuable insights into the feasibility and potential success of xenotransplantation, offering a bridge between scientific advancements and clinical application.},

  abstract = {Following our previous experience with cardiac xenotransplantation of a genetically modified porcine heart into a live human, we sought to achieve improved results by selecting a healthier recipient and through more sensitive donor screening for potential zoonotic pathogens. Here we transplanted a 10-gene-edited pig heart into a 58-year-old man with progressive, debilitating inotrope-dependent heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy who was not a candidate for standard advanced heart failure therapies. He was maintained on a costimulation (anti-CD40L, Tegoprubart) blockade-based immunomodulatory regimen. The xenograft initially functioned well, with excellent systolic and diastolic function during the first several weeks posttransplantation. Subsequently, the xenograft developed rapidly progressing diastolic heart failure, biventricular wall thickening and, ultimately, near-complete loss of systolic function necessitating initiation of extracorporeal membranous oxygenation on day 31. Given these setbacks, the patient chose to transition to comfort care after 40\,days. As with our first patient, histology did not reveal substantial immune cell infiltration but suggested capillary endothelial injury with interstitial edema and early fibrosis. No evidence of porcine cytomegalovirus replication in the xenograft was observed. Strategies to overcome the obstacle of antibody-mediated rejection are needed to advance the field of xenotransplantation.},

  abstract = {Xenotransplantation research has made considerable progress in recent years, largely through the increasing availability of pigs with multiple genetic modifications. We suggest that a pig with nine genetic modifications (ie, currently available) will provide organs (initially kidneys and hearts) that would function for a clinically valuable period of time, for example, {$>$}12 months, after transplantation into patients with endstage organ failure. The national regulatory authorities, however, will likely require evidence, based on in vitro and/or in vivo experimental data, to justify the inclusion of each individual genetic modification in the pig. We provide data both from our own experience and that of others on the advantages of pigs in which (a) all three known carbohydrate xenoantigens have been deleted (triple‐knockout pigs), (b) two human complement‐regulatory proteins (CD46, CD55) and two human coagulation‐regulatory proteins (thrombomodulin, endothelial cell protein C receptor) are expressed, (c) the anti‐apoptotic and “anti‐inflammatory” molecule, human hemeoxygenase‐1 is expressed, and (d) human CD47 is expressed to suppress elements of the macrophage and T‐cell responses. Although many alternative genetic modifications could be made to an organ‐source pig, we suggest that the genetic manipulations we identify above will all contribute to the success of the initial clinical pig kidney or heart transplants, and that the beneficial contribution of each individual manipulation is supported by considerable experimental evidence.},

Despite significant ethical, scientific, and practical challenges, recent advancements in liver xenotransplantation, particularly using pigs as donors for non-human primates (NHPs), have extended graft survival duration. However, life-threatening issues such as thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders persist, limiting survival to under a month. Advances in genetic engineering have enabled the modification of pig genomes to match the human immune system better, targeting genes responsible for immune rejection and increasing compatibility. While these breakthroughs enhance the potential for human transplantation, the challenges of immune rejection and long-term functionality remain substantial. This review highlights recent progress in liver xenotransplantation from pigs to NHPs and explores the implications for potential human clinical application.},

  abstract = {Gene-edited pig organ transplantation can solve the serious shortage of human donor organs. Currently, xenotransplantation is rapidly developing and has made significant breakthroughs. The use of GTKO (Gal knockout) pigs is an important step forward. The subsequent knockout of three genes combined with the transfer of immune-related genes effectively prolonged the survival time of non-human primate (NHP) transplantation in xenotransplantation. Due to the success of allogeneic kidney transplantation on NHP, this gene editing protocol was recently applied to clinical patients. Two patients underwent allogeneic kidney transplantation and survived for 51~days and 47~days. Exceeding the hyperacute rejection period proves that appropriate gene editing strategies and the combination of immunosuppressive agents contribute to the success of xenotransplantation. To further enhance the feasibility of pig kidney xenograft, this article mainly explores the effects of the NHP xenograft gene editing scheme and immunosuppressants on prolonging transplant survival time.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}异种移植是克服供器官短缺的有效途径之一。但异种移植供体与受体之间的分子不相容性会引起排斥反应，大大限制了异种移植的临床应用。近年来研究人员通过猪-猴及猪-脑死亡受者异种移植模型深入探究了异种移植排斥反应的机制，发现固有免疫在排斥反应中发挥了重要作用。巨噬细胞作为固有免疫中的吞噬细胞，不仅通过吞噬作用损伤异种移植物，还与其他免疫细胞交互影响异种移植的免疫微环境。但由于巨噬细胞具有异质性，其在异种移植排斥反应中的表型和功能仍不明确，因此有必要对巨噬细胞在异种移植排斥反应中扮演的角色进行深入探究。本文就巨噬细胞在异种移植排斥反应中的最新研究进展进行综述，旨在探讨巨噬细胞参与异种移植排斥反应的机制，以期为后续研究提供参考。{$<$}/p{$>$}},
